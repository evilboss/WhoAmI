# WhoAmI
WhoAmI gives Amazon's Alexa the ability to tell you what it sees. WhoAmI is triggered by Alexa requests to describe what it sees or take a selfie. WhoAmI calls Microsoft's Face API and Vision Services API to interpret video images, returning a natural language response using Alexa.

WhoAmI is developed to explore image recognition and Alexa skill development. And also relearned Python along the way and how to utlize a Raspberry Pi as a web server and IoT device.

Key learning opportunities from WhoAmI:
1.	Alexa skill development
2.	Utilize Raspberry Pi as a web server
3.	Microsoft Cognitive Services: Face API, Vision Services API
4.	Alexa skills directives
5.	Sending Email
6.	Python Flask and Amazon Ask web services framework (Flask-Ask)
